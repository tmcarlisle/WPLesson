## Introduction
WordPress is a great tool for creating a blog or website especially for those who don’t want to do much html coding. WordPress allows you to choose a template or “theme” for your website that provides the basic format for underlying for the website. 

But before diving into WordPress, it is important to consider what you want your website to communicate, keeping your targeted audience in mind. 

Think about the story that you want to tell with the text, images, and other media you have gathered through your research. Sometimes it helps to first draw out a sketch to get an idea of how you want to organize the content, especially if you working in a group. Remember to keep it simple! You can always add more later. 

Once you have a plan sketched out, it’s time to start creating the website and so let’s dive into WordPress.
