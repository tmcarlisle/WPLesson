## Introduction
WordPress is a great tool for creating a blog or website especially for those who don’t want to do much html coding. WordPress allows you to choose a template or “theme” for your website that provides the structure and format for your website. 

But before diving into WordPress, it is important to consider what you want your website to communicate, always keep your audience in mind. 

Think about the story that you want to tell with the text, images, and other media you have gathered through your research. Sometimes it helps to first draw out a sketch to get an idea of how you want to organize the content, especially if you working in a group. 

Remember to keep it simple! You can always add more later. 

Once you have a plan sketched out, you are ready to create the website.

## Getting Started
Now let's dive into WordPress. After logging in with your username and password you are on the main administration screen called the Dashboard.
